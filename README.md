THESE RULES COME FROM THE GROUP ADMINS

Be Kind and Courteous

We’re all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let’s treat everyone with respect. Healthy debate are natural, but kindness is required.

No Hate Speech or Bullying 

Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn’t allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will not be tolerated.

Being part of this group requires mutual trust. Authentic expressive discussion make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What’s in the group should stay in the group.

Fact checkers 

We’re commented to fight the spread of false information. In certain countries, we work with independent fact-checkers who are certified through the non-partisan international Fact-checkers Network to help identify and review false information. Fact-checkers check the fact and rate the accuracy of information.
